# Introduction
This is a my personal repository of notes; mostly related to computer science. Since
books contain a lot of unnecessary knowledge in-between important stuff, it's crucial to
have a persisent container of all the important bits of understanding you made from the
book. Personally I gather my knowledge from multiple sources on one topic, so it's even
crucial for me to have a repository like this.
